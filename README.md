This respository is a summation of significant contributions made within my tenure (Lucas Valliere) as an Undergraduate Researcher for the Atmospheric Composition Earth Data Science Group. My work was supervised by Professor Sam J. Silva with contributions by Obin Sturm and Emy Li.

# Instruction

Before running/building any code, make sure to download ChemicalCase.py and gckpp_EdgeList.csv. Place these in the same directory you plan to run your code. The code will not work otherwise.

The varying code blocks rely on in-code-written .csv files. Currently, there are two: one for a timescale focus, and one for a betweenness centrality focus. To build these .csv files, first download the .txt files from the Google Drive. These need to be in the format of Beijing_L1_20180402_1530.txt, for example. Download and organize these files by location. 
Place these in a directory, and reference this directory path when writing the .txt files, and you should be good to go! 


In the code block, replace any syntax containing "file_path," or something smiliar, with your own respective .csv file paths.

imports follow PEP-8 formatting.
